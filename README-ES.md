[中文](./README.md) | **English**

A basic framework suitable for the development of medium and large projects requires a certain understanding of `vue`, `typescript`, and can also be used as an example of understanding the new wording, and adapt to the development method of subsequent new versions in advance

The project is based on the vue3 style background management system implemented by `ant-design-vue`, `typescript`, `vue-composition-api`, `TSX`

Compatible with vue2 browsers, everything is free and does not charge any fees, please rest assured to use. Subsequent regular updates and maintenance are provided for reference and learning

### Document

The document has not been completely written, it is still being written...

[https://vvbin.cn/docs](vue-vben-admin-docs)

### Why write this

At present, there is no relevant background system written using `composition-api` and `typescript` on the Internet, so I will share what I wrote. New features will be added in the future, and when `vue3` is completely stable, A version of `vue3` will be provided. The cost of switching to `vue3` after this project is relatively low, and the subsequent one-click version switching will be made

### Why use composition-api

The biggest reason is that we still need to be compatible with `ie11`, `ie9` and `ie10`. We may need to modify the compatibility of css and some plug-ins by ourselves. When `vue3` is stable, it will support `ie11` at most, so we will use it temporarily `vue-composition-api` for development

## Technology used

- vue2.6.11(Vue3 version will be provided later)
- composition-api
- vuex@3.4.0

- vue-router@3.3.4

## install

```js
git config core.ignorecase false # Make git case sensitive to file names

// Pull project code
git clone https://github.com/anncwb/vue-vben-admin.git

cd vue-vben-admin

//  It is best to use yarn/npm, otherwise hot update may cause problems
yarn install

```

## Terminal

### Start the development environment

```bash
yarn serve
```

### Build

At the same time, the file name `window-glob.js` configuration file will be generated, and the project configuration can dynamically modify the file and update the code variables in real time, such as the interface address

```bash

yarn build # Packaging will use hardSource for packaging

yarn build:no-cache # Packaging will not use hardSource for packaging

yarn report # Generate build package table preview
```

### unit test

```bash
yarn test:unit # --watch : Track file changes
```

### format

```bash
yarn lint:stylelint # Style formatting

yarn lint:prettier # js/ts code formatting
```

### Other

```bash
yarn reinstall # Remove dependencies and reinstall, compatible with window

yarn preview # Package preview locally

yarn log # Generate CHANGELOG
```
